1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:02,304
Spent the last little while

2
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:04,608
Fixing my bike

3
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:06,144
Check these breaks out

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,424
Check out how bad these were

5
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:08,960
Please hear what

6
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:10,752
Ideapad should look like

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,288
And I'm Tom

8
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,336
Poem

9
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:16,384
These were what I pulled off the truck

10
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,408
And if you Lucky

11
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,176
You can see here

12
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:19,712
This matter was

13
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,248
Totally scraping off

14
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,808
As opposed to what it should look like there

15
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:28,160
And then I found the culprit looks like the spring that holds them on

16
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,440
Porsche

17
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,976
Totally twisted over

18
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,280
It's really a good thing that I found this

19
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:36,096
I need the brakes for bad but I didn't know there were this bad

20
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,632
Turns out that I don't have a

21
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,680
Spur spring but I have a spare set of brakes

22
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:40,704
You're gonna have to

23
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,008
The trying to find a bike shop around it might be able to

24
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,032
Help me find us

25
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:44,800
Spring

26
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,336
So that I can replace the brakes

27
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:49,920
Impossible I think I'll just redo the brakes on both sides and by 2

28
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:52,992
Two replacements that by now gonna head out gonna get some lunch

29
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,784
Oh is this a vegetarian

30
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,416
Animal for bed

31
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,232
To eat or to bring

32
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,912
I know that we've

33
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,960

Call that thing

90
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,903
Back in Kent Place

00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,583
Prince the

93
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,375
Guiding theme of the second half of

94
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,399
This day was

95
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,703
Getting my brakes fixed too I'm the trunk

96
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,727
And I noticed I never

97
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,543
You want the Giants

98
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,847
I store here and it was a small place in the

99
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,383
This area isn't too big

100
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,151
Console

101
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,687
They didn't have the disc brakes

102
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223
Hello I'd like to

103
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
We break style

104
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,271
I did have

105
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,319
My spring which was bent in

106
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,367
Sorted and I was able to

107
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
Band

108
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,903

Break area so

111
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,815
I think when I get to the next city

112
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,863
Which is actually through the mountains

113
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,399
A couple of days right

114
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:38,495
Away I'm gonna stop and we're gonna get the new caliper

115
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,775
And new brakes

116
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,311
For us

117
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,871
For both sides except for the new brakes on Wednesday

118
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,991

119
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,271
Couple of days ride

121
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,879

127
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,119
That instead of riding around the

128
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:05,887
